## Power and Energy Systems (Quantum Computing Context)

### Why Quantum Computers Are Needed

Quantum computers are particularly suited for **time-intensive and computation-heavy tasks** that are impractical for classical systems due to exponential complexity.

Typical characteristics of such tasks include:
- Large state spaces
- High-dimensional optimization
- Probabilistic and stochastic simulations
- Real-time decision-making under uncertainty

- Characteristics:
  - 50–1000 qubits
  - No full fault tolerance
  - Susceptible to noise and decoherence
- Despite limitations, NISQ devices can still deliver **quantum advantage** for specific use cases such as:
  - Optimization
  - Hybrid quantum–classical simulations
  - Energy system modeling

### Grid Partitioning and Microgrid Islanding

**Why does grid partitioning (microgrid islanding) present an opportunity for quantum advantage?**

- Microgrid islanding requires:
  - Rapid optimization
  - Real-time load balancing
  - Fault isolation under uncertainty

## Data Generation in Large Power Grids

### Analytical Question

**Which factor contributes most directly to the 25 TB of daily data generated in a 3,000-node grid?**

**Correct Answer:**  
- **Large-scale Monte Carlo scenario exploration**

**Explanation:**
- Monte Carlo simulations generate massive datasets by evaluating thousands to millions of probabilistic grid scenarios.
- Used for:
  - Reliability analysis
  - Contingency planning
  - Renewable integration uncertainty
- Other options contribute data, but not at this scale:
  - PMU synchronization → high frequency, limited scope
  - Quantum sensors → not yet widely deployed
  - Transformer temperature monitoring → low-dimensional telemetry
