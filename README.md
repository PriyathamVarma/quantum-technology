# Module 1: Foundations of Quantum Computing

---

## 1. Evolution and Historical Milestones

Quantum computing is the result of a century-long evolution in physics that gradually merged with information science.

- **1927 – Fifth Solvay Conference**  
  Considered a foundational moment in quantum mechanics. The conference hosted pivotal debates between Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr on the nature of reality.  
  These discussions led to the **Copenhagen Interpretation**, which underpins modern understanding of quantum states and qubit behavior.

- **From von Neumann to Quantum Architecture**  
  - **Classical systems:** Follow the von Neumann architecture, where the CPU and memory are separate, creating a performance bottleneck.  
  - **Quantum systems:** Computation occurs within the quantum state itself, reducing dependence on data movement and enabling new computational paradigms.

## 2. Core Technical Concepts

Quantum computing is built on two fundamental principles.

### 2.1 Qubits (Quantum Bits)

A classical bit can exist only in one of two states: `0` or `1`.  
A **qubit**, however, leverages **superposition** to exist in a linear combination of both states simultaneously.

- **Superposition:**  
  A qubit can be represented as  
  \[
  |\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle
  \]  
  where \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are probability amplitudes.

- **Entanglement:**  
  A uniquely quantum phenomenon where two or more qubits become correlated such that the state of one instantly affects the state of the other, regardless of physical distance.

### 2.2 Key Quantum Algorithms

1. **Shor’s Algorithm**  
   - Efficiently factors large integers.  
   - Demonstrates that widely used public-key cryptographic systems (e.g., RSA) are vulnerable to sufficiently powerful quantum computers.

2. **Grover’s Search Algorithm**  
   - Searches an unstructured database of \( N \) items in approximately \( \sqrt{N} \) steps.  
   - Offers a quadratic speedup over classical linear search algorithms.

## 3. Industry Impact of Quantum Computing

Quantum computing is especially powerful for problems involving **optimization**, **probabilistic analysis**, and **physical simulation**—many of which are infeasible for classical supercomputers.

## 4. Classical vs. Quantum Computing: Summary Comparison

| Feature        | Classical Computing (Bit) | Quantum Computing (Qubit)        |
|----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| State          | 0 or 1                    | 0 and 1 (Superposition)           |
| Computational Power | Linear scaling \( O(N) \) | Exponential scaling \( O(2^N) \) |
| Logical Model  | Boolean logic              | Quantum gates and linear algebra |
| Error Rate     | Very low                   | High (due to decoherence)        |
